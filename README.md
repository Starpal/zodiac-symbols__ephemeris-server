## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* Nodejs >= 14 (also you can use docker)
* python (python is used for node-gyp to compile c++ swiss ephemeris library)

### Setup

0. You need to install dependencies of [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) depending on your OS. Follow the instructions to install it depending on your OS [https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)


1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:ryuphi/astrology-api.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies

    ##### without Docker

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    *Also you can use `npm run dev`, this option run with nodemon to watch changes.*

### Usage

Example: Get the horoscope for date `1993-08-06`, time `16:50:00` with timezone `-04:00` at Santiago, Chile (latitude `-33.41167` and longitude `-70.66647`) using Placidus houses system.

Fist, you need to transform the date & time to ISO8601, for this example `1993-08-06T16:50:00-04:00`.

Second, __you must escape the date and time when you make the request__.
This is because if the time zone is with a positive sign, for example +05:00,
when sending it through the request, the url will take the + sign as a space and not as the + sign.
For this example it would be `1993-08-06T16%3A50%3A00-04%3A00`. See issue [#10](https://github.com/ryuphi/astrology-api/issues/10)

If you don't want to escape the date and time, you can always send it to UTC ðŸ™‚

In UTC: `1993-08-06T20:50:00Z`

Then, you need to select the house system from the houses system table.. in this case for the placidus system you need to send the `P` value in the `houseSystem` query param.

Now you can send this...

##### Using cURL

```bash
# escaped
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://localhost:3000/horoscope?time=1993-08-06T16%3A50%3A00-04%3A00&latitude=-33.41167&longitude=-70.66647&houseSystem=P'
```

```bash
# in utc
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://localhost:3000/horoscope?time=1993-08-06T20:50:00Z&latitude=-33.41167&longitude=-70.66647&houseSystem=P'
```
